# Minesweeper
An AI module for a minesweeper robot is implemented in Haskell. 
The environment in which the robot operates is an 4 Ã— 4 grid of cells. 
Initially, a cell on the grid is either empty, contains the robot, or contains a mine. 
The robot can move in all four directions and is able to collect a mine only if it is in the same cell as the mine. 
The program will take as input the initial position of the robot and the positions of all of the mines. 
The objective of the AI module is to compute a sequence of actions that the robot can follow in order to go to all the mines and collect them.
